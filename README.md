# 🧠 Project-Based Learning Journey

Welcome!  
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey inspired by the amazing  
[**Project-Based Learning**](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning) collection.  

My goal is to **strengthen existing skills** and **learn new technologies** through real-world projects — each focusing on different domains like web, backend, and mobile development.

## 🚀 About This Repository

Each project lives in its own folder and includes:
- 🧩 **Project Overview:** What I built and why
- 💡 **Key Concepts:** What I learned or practiced
- ⚙️ **Tech Stack:** Languages, frameworks, or tools used
- 🧠 **Reflections:** My thoughts, takeaways, and what I’d do differently

This is both a personal log and a public way to share my progress with others learning along the way.
